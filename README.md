# SimulatedScores
A walkthrough to demonstrate functional and procedural styles in C#.

Source code for a C# .NET Core console application to accompany the "Programming Style - Functional vs Procedural" blog post.

The master branch contains just the baseline code, nothing interesting here. There are 2 additional branches,
Functional and Procedural, which contain equivalent solutions using the respective programming styles.

Both branches (Functional and Procedural) contain matching sets of commits that represent progress of the walkthrough depicted
in the blog post.
