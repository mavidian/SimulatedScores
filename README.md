# SimulatedScores
A walkthrough demonstrating functional and procedural styles in C#.

Source code for a C# .NET Core console application to accompany the [Programming in Style - Procedural vs Functional](https://mavidian.com/2019/10/14/programming-in-style-procedural-vs-functional.html) blog post.

The master branch contains just the baseline code - a starting point of the walkthrough. There are 2 additional branches, procedural and functional, which contain equivalent solutions using the respective programming styles.

Both branches (procedural and functional) contain matching sets of commits that represent progress of the walkthrough depicted
in the blog post.
